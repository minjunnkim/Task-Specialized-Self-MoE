# An Introduction to Task Specialization in NLP Using a Simple Self-MoE Framework for Sentiment Analysis

## Objective
This project introduces and validates the concept of the Hybrid Self-MoE framework through a sentiment analysis task. The goal is to demonstrate how task specialization, combined with sparse activation, can improve performance and efficiency in NLP tasks.

---

## Problem Formulation
Traditional sentiment analysis models often treat the task as a monolithic problem, which may overlook nuances in language. This project aims to show how dividing the sentiment analysis task into smaller, specialized components (experts) can yield better performance.

## Simplified Self-MoE Framework Design

### Task Specialization
The model consists of three expert modules:
1. **Positive Sentiment Expert**: Specializes in identifying features associated with positive sentiment.
2. **Negative Sentiment Expert**: Focuses on detecting negative sentiment expressions.
3. **Neutral Sentiment Expert**: Handles cases with neutral or ambiguous language.

### Gating Mechanism
A simplified gating function analyzes input features and routes each input to the most relevant expert. The routing decision is based on simple heuristics or a lightweight classifier.

## Data and Baseline Models

### Dataset
- **IMDb Movie Reviews**: For binary sentiment classification (positive or negative).
- **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)**: For fine-grained sentiment analysis.

### Baseline Models
1. **Majority Class Baseline**: Always predicts the majority class.
2. **NBOW (Neural Bag-of-Words)**: Uses word embeddings averaged over the input sequence.

---

## Experimental Setup

### Model Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Tokenize and embed input text using pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe or fastText).
- **Gating Mechanism**: A simple classifier decides which expert to activate based on features like sentiment word counts.
- **Task Experts**: Each expert is a small feedforward neural network trained to handle a specific sentiment class.
- **Output Layer**: The output of the selected expert is used for the final sentiment prediction.

### Training
- Use cross-entropy loss for training.
- Ensure each expert specializes in its designated sentiment class.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate the model on a development and test set.
- Report metrics: **accuracy**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
